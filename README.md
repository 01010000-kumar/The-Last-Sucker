# Credits
This chatbot uses a small subset of the [comments made available by /u/Stuck_In_the_Matrix](https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/comments/3bxlg7/i_have_every_publicly_available_reddit_comment) as it's dataset.
Specifcally all the reddit comments for the month of October 2007. The chatbot is quite slow, taking up to a minute to respond on my i3 processor.
<br>
<br>
It works by finding the similarity between the text given to it and all the comments in it's dataset.
It then finds the most similar comment that has replies and prints out the highest rated reply.
The larger the dataset the better the replies, but longer the response time.

# How To Use
